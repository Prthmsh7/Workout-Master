## 🧠 How It Works

WorkOut Master uses a sophisticated algorithm to generate personalized workouts based on:

1. Your selected workout type (Individual, Bro Split, etc.)
2. Target muscle groups
3. Fitness goals (strength, hypertrophy, endurance)

The application then creates a balanced workout with appropriate sets, reps, and rest periods, drawing from a database of effective exercises. As you complete workouts, the application tracks your progress and stores your history for future reference.
